## The project <a name="project"></a>
This project allows children to build their own origami vibration robot. This way, children can explore different folding patterns and combine these with a vibration motor to see what works for making a little robot that moves.

Once the robots have been folded, it's a nice idea to have children race their robots again each other on a flat track (maybe inclined a little).

## What do I need? <a name="materials"></a>
To make the robots, you need:

1. Origami paper (15x15cm(
2. Vibration motor
3. Coin cell (2032)
4. Tape
5. Optional: decoration

## How to make the robots <a name="assembly"></a>

Follow the folding manual: https://github.com/kvriet/Origami-vibration-robot/blob/main/Folding%20manuals/Fold%20a%20vibration%20robot%20v1.pdf
Then tape the leads of the vibration motor to the two sides of the coin cell. Tape the vibration motor + coin cell onto the origami robot (if you want you can use double-sided tape here. Tape for fixing photographs works well here).
Your robot is now ready, but you can also decide to decorate it. Here's an example of a decorated robot:
