## The project <a name="project"></a>
This project allows children to build their own origami vibration robot. This way, children can explore folding patterns and combine these with a vibration motor to see what works for making a little robot that moves.

Once the robots have been folded, it's a nice idea to have children race their robots again each other on a flat track (maybe inclined a little).

Children can also design their own robot:

## What do I need? <a name="materials"></a>
To make the robots, you need:

1. Origami paper (15x15cm(
2. Vibration motor
3. Coin cell (2032)
4. Tape
5. Googly eyes
6. Optional: decoration

## How to make the robots <a name="assembly"></a>

Follow the folding manual: https://github.com/kvriet/Origami-vibration-robot/blob/main/Folding%20manuals/Fold%20a%20vibration%20robot%20v1.pdf
Then tape the leads of the vibration motor to the two sides of the coin cell. Tape the vibration motor + coin cell onto the origami robot (if you want you can use double-sided tape here. Tape for fixing photographs works well here).

The robots in the pictures have custom PCBs designed by Dico Kruining and me, but tape also works. Many thanks to Dico for helping me design the PCBs and soldering them!

Your robot is now ready, but you can also decide to decorate it. Here's an example of a decorated robot:
